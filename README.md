# Firmware-Development-of-aBluetooth-Low-Energy-Applicationfor-Audio-Recording-of-a-Songbird
In this repository the code for an in-vivo audio sensor based on a nordic nrf 52832 SoC gets presented. The sensor is able to send data via BLE to a  central device which is also based on the nrf52832 SoC. The code for the central is also presented in this repository. 
To get a better understanding of the hardware and firmware implemented I recommend taking a look at the thesis which will also be uploaded to the repo.
Additionally you can find some python code which converts the over bluetooth received pcm-data into a wav file which is playable on almost every device.
